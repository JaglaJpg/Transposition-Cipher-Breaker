# Genetic Algorithm Transposition Cipher Breaker

### **Overview**
A Python program that uses a genetic algorithm to decrypt columnar transposition ciphers with high accuracy. The project demonstrates proficiency in algorithm design and statistical methods.

### **Key Features**
- Implements a genetic algorithm to find the most likely key for decryption.
- Uses statistical analysis (e.g., digrams, trigrams) to calculate the fitness of potential keys.
- Outputs decrypted plaintext with high accuracy.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**

### **Setup and Running the Program**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaglaJpg/Transposition-Cipher-Breaker
2. Go to the project
2.1. If you do not have python install it with
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run it with 
  python GeneticAlgorithmCipherBreaker.py
